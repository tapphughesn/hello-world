# hello-world
My first repository

I am writing this line at 3:59 PM January 4th 2018. I am about to start the Spring semester of my freshman year of college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I will be taking a Foundations of Programming class, and I am hoping to major in Math or Computer Science. 

This line was written in a branch called first-branch, iirc. I am going to end up reintegrating this change (this line) into the master branch. The guide reccommends that I include some info about myself, but I already did that with a commit in the master branch.
