My first repository

I am writing this line at 3:59 PM January 4th 2018. I am about to start the Spring semester of my freshman year of college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I will be taking a Foundations of Programming class, and I am hoping to major in Math or Computer Science.
